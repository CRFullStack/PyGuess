# PyGuess
A fun python guessing game


A simple python script that has you guess a number between 1 -100. It will keep a track of how many attempts it takes to guess the correct number. Be careful, it you get it wrong you'll get an insult hurled your way by the computer. You're able to add and delete insults via the insult.txt file provided or you can supply a path to your own insult file. My lowest score so far is 5, who can beat it?
